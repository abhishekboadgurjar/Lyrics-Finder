## Introduction

In this tutorial, we'll create a Lyrics Finder web application using React. This project is perfect for those looking to practice integrating APIs, managing state, and displaying dynamic content.

## Project Overview

The Lyrics Finder allows users to search for song lyrics by entering the song title and artist name. It fetches the lyrics from a public API and displays them on the screen. Users can quickly find and read the lyrics of their favorite songs.

## Features

- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for lyrics by song title and artist name.
- **API Integration**: Fetches lyrics from a public lyrics API.
- **Dynamic Content**: Displays lyrics dynamically based on user input.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and easy-to-use interface for searching and viewing lyrics.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: For building the user interface and managing component states.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For handling API requests and app logic.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

```
├── public
├── src
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── LyricsFinder.jsx
│   │   ├── SearchForm.jsx
│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── App.css
│   ├── index.js
│   └── index.css

```

### Key Components
